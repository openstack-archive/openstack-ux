Mission
-------

The mission of the UX Program is to support and facilitate cross-project
efforts to improve the overall user experience of OpenStack. We provide user
research to help teams identify any issues preventing adoption of their
services as well as help the projects validate design and development efforts
to address those issues. In addition, we help the project teams create
solutions to address customer needs and pain points. Finally, we will provide
the OpenStack community with visibility into any user experience issues
related to inconsistency across projects.

The UX team is not prescriptive; our goal is to collaborate with OpenStackâ€™s
projects to create better experiences.
